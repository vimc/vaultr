custom_mount:
  short: >-
    Set up a \code{vault_client_transit} object at a custom mount.
    For example, suppose you mounted the \code{transit} secret
    backend at \code{/transit2} you might use \code{tr <-
    vault$secrets$transit$custom_mount("/transit2")} - this pattern
    is repeated for other secret and authentication backends.
  params:
    mount: String, indicating the path that the engine is mounted at.

key_create:
  short: >-
    Create a new named encryption key of the specified type. The
    values set here cannot be changed after key creation.
  params:
    name: >-
      Name for the key.  This will be used in all future interactions
      with the key - the key itself is not returned.
    key_type: |-
      Specifies the type of key to create.  The default is
      \code{aes256-gcm96}. The currently-supported types are:

      \describe{

      \item{\code{aes256-gcm96}}{AES-256 wrapped with GCM using a
      96-bit nonce size AEAD (symmetric, supports derivation and
      convergent encryption)}

      \item{\code{chacha20-poly1305}}{ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD
      (symmetric, supports derivation and convergent encryption)}

      \item{\code{ed25519}}{ED25519 (asymmetric, supports
      derivation). When using derivation, a sign operation with the
      same context will derive the same key and signature; this is a
      signing analogue to \code{convergent_encryption}}

      \item{\code{ecdsa-p256}}{ECDSA using the P-256 elliptic curve
      (asymmetric)}

      \item{\code{rsa-2048}}{RSA with bit size of 2048 (asymmetric)}

      \item{\code{rsa-4096}}{RSA with bit size of 4096 (asymmetric)}
      }
    convergent_encryption: >-
      Logical with default of \code{FALSE}.  If \code{TRUE}, then the
      key will support convergent encryption, where the same plaintext
      creates the same ciphertext. This requires derived to be set to
      true. When enabled, each encryption(/decryption/rewrap/datakey)
      operation will derive a \code{nonce} value rather than randomly
      generate it.
    derived: >-
      Specifies if key derivation is to be used. If enabled, all
      encrypt/decrypt requests to this named key must provide a
      context which is used for key derivation (default is
      \code{FALSE}).
    exportable: >-
      Enables keys to be exportable. This allows for all the valid
      keys in the key ring to be exported. Once set, this cannot be
      disabled (default is \code{FALSE}).
    allow_plaintext_backup: >-
      If set, enables taking backup of named key in the plaintext
      format. Once set, this cannot be disabled (default is
      \code{FALSE}).

key_read:
  short: >-
    Read information about a previously generated key.  The returned
    object shows the creation time of each key version; the values are
    not the keys themselves. Depending on the type of key, different
    information may be returned, e.g. an asymmetric key will return
    its public key in a standard format for the type.
  params:
    name: The name of the key to read

key_list:
  short: >-
    List names of all keys

key_delete:
  short: >-
    Delete a key by name.  It will no longer be possible to decrypt
    any data encrypted with the named key. Because this is a
    potentially catastrophic operation, the \code{deletion_allowed}
    tunable must be set using \code{$key_update()}.
  params:
    name: The name of the key to delete.

key_update:
  short: >-
    This method allows tuning configuration values for a given
    key. (These values are returned during a read operation on the
    named key.)
  params:
    name: The name of the key to update
    min_decryption_version: >-
      Specifies the minimum version of ciphertext allowed to be
      decrypted, as an integer (default is \code{0}). Adjusting this
      as part of a key rotation policy can prevent old copies of
      ciphertext from being decrypted, should they fall into the wrong
      hands. For signatures, this value controls the minimum version
      of signature that can be verified against. For HMACs, this
      controls the minimum version of a key allowed to be used as the
      key for verification.
    min_encryption_version: >-
      Specifies the minimum version of the key that can be used to
      encrypt plaintext, sign payloads, or generate HMACs, as an
      integer (default is \code{0}).  Must be 0 (which will use the
      latest version) or a value greater or equal to
      \code{min_decryption_version}.
    deletion_allowed: >-
      Specifies if the key is allowed to be deleted, as a logical
      (default is \code{FALSE}).
    exportable: >-
      Enables keys to be exportable. This allows for all the valid
      keys in the key ring to be exported. Once set, this cannot be
      disabled.
    allow_plaintext_backup: >-
      If set, enables taking backup of named key in the plaintext
      format. Once set, this cannot be disabled.

key_rotate:
  short: >-
    Rotates the version of the named key. After rotation, new
    plaintext requests will be encrypted with the new version of the
    key. To upgrade ciphertext to be encrypted with the latest version
    of the key, use the rewrap endpoint. This is only supported with
    keys that support encryption and decryption operations.
  params:
    name: The name of the key to rotate

key_export:
  short: >-
    Export the named key. If version is specified, the specific
    version will be returned. If latest is provided as the version,
    the current key will be provided. Depending on the type of key,
    different information may be returned. The key must be exportable
    to support this operation and the version must still be valid.
  details: >-
    For more details see
    \url{https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/2667} where
    HashiCorp says "Part of the "contract" of transit is that the key
    is never exposed outside of Vault. We added the ability to export
    keys because some enterprises have key escrow requirements, but it
    leaves a permanent mark in the key metadata. I suppose we could at
    some point allow importing a key and also leave such a mark."
  params:
    name: Name of the key to export
    key_type: >-
      Specifies the type of the key to export. Valid values are:
      \code{encryption-key}, \code{signing-key} and \code{hmac-key}.
    version: >-
      Specifies the version of the key to read. If omitted, all
      versions of the key will be returned. If the version is set to
      latest, the current key will be returned

data_encrypt:
  short: >-
    This endpoint encrypts the provided plaintext using the named
    key.
  params:
    key_name: Specifies the name of the encryption key to encrypt against.

      version. Must be greater than or equal to the key's
      \code{min_encryption_version}, if set.
    context: &context >-
      Specifies the context for key derivation. This is required if
      key derivation is enabled for this key.  Must be a raw vector.

      \code{$data_encrypt}.
    context: *context

data_rewrap:
  short: >-

    named key. Because this never returns plaintext, it is possible to
    delegate this functionality to untrusted users or scripts.
  params:
    key_name: Specifies the name of the encryption key to re-encrypt against
    data: >-
      The data to decrypt.  Must be a string, as returned by
      \code{$data_encrypt}.
    context: *context
    key_version: >-
      Specifies the version of the key to use for the operation. If
      not set, uses the latest version. Must be greater than or equal
      to the key's \code{min_encryption_version}, if set.

datakey_create:
  short: >-

hash:
  short: >-
    Generates a cryptographic hash of given data using the specified
    algorithm.
  params:

      R object, one option is to use \code{unserialize(x, NULL)} but
      be aware that version information may be included.
      Alternatively, for a string, one might use \code{charToRaw}.
    algorithm: >-
      A string indicating the hash algorithm to use.  The exact set of
      supported algorithms may depend by vault server version, but as
      of version 1.0.0 vault supports \code{sha2-224},

hmac:
  short: >-
    This endpoint returns the digest of given data using the specified
    hash algorithm and the named key. The key can be of any type
    supported by the \code{transit} engine; the raw key will be
