list:
  short: >-
    List token accessors, returning a character vector

capabilities:
  short: >-
    Fetch the capabilities of a token on the given paths. The
    capabilities returned will be derived from the policies that are
    on the token, and from the policies to which the token is entitled
    to through the entity and entity's group memberships.
  params:
    path: Vector of paths on which capabilities are being queried
    token: Single token for which capabilities are being queried

capabilities_self:
  short: >-
    As for the \code{capabilities} method, but for the client token
    used to make the request.
  params:
    path: Vector of paths on which capabilities are being queried

capabilities_accessor:
  short: >-
    As for the \code{capabilities} method, but using a token
    \emph{accessor} rather than a token itself.
  params:
    path: Vector of paths on which capabilities are being queried
    accessor: Accessor of the token for which capabilities are being queried

client:
  short: >-
    Return the current client token

create:
  short: >-
    Create a new token
  params:
    role_name: The name of the token role
    id: >-
      The ID of the client token. Can only be specified by a root
      token. Otherwise, the token ID is a randomly generated value
    policies: >-
      A character vector of policies for the token. This must be a
      subset of the policies belonging to the token making the
      request, unless root. If not specified, defaults to all the
      policies of the calling token.
    meta: >-
      A named list of strings as metadata to pass through to audit
       devices.
    orphan: >-
      Logical, indicating if the token created should be an orphan
      (they will have no parent). As such, they will not be
      automatically revoked by the revocation of any other token.
    no_default_policy: >-
      Logical, if \code{TRUE}, then the default policy will not be
      contained in this token's policy set.
    max_ttl: >-
      Provides a maximum lifetime for any tokens issued against this
      role, including periodic tokens. Unlike direct token creation,
      where the value for an explicit max TTL is stored in the token,
      for roles this check will always use the current value set in
      the role. The main use of this is to provide a hard upper bound
      on periodic tokens, which otherwise can live forever as long as
      they are renewed. This is an integer number of seconds
    display_name: >-
      The display name of the token
    num_uses: >-
      Maximum number of uses that a token can have.  This can be used
      to create a one-time-token or limited use token. The default, or
      the value of 0, has no limit to the number of uses.
    period: >-
      If specified, the token will be periodic; it will have no
      maximum TTL (unless a \code{max_ttl} is also set) but every
      renewal will use the given period. Requires a root/sudo token to
      use.
    ttl: >-
      The TTL period of the token, provided as "1h", where hour is the
      largest suffix. If not provided, the token is valid for the
      default lease TTL, or indefinitely if the root policy is used.

lookup:
  short: Returns information about the client token
  params:
    token: The token to lookup

lookup_self:
  short: >-
    Returns information about the current client token (as if calling
    \code{$lookup} with the token the client is using.

lookup_accessor:
  short: >-
    Returns information about the client token from the accessor.
  params:
    accessor: The token accessor to lookup

renew:
  short: >-
    Renews a lease associated with a token. This is used to prevent
    the expiration of a token, and the automatic revocation of
    it. Token renewal is possible only if there is a lease associated
    with it.
  params:
    token: The token to renew
    increment: &increment >-
      An optional requested lease increment can be provided. This
      increment may be ignored.  If given, it should be a duration
      (e.g., \code{1h}).

renew_self:
  short: >-
    Renews a lease associated with the calling token. This is used to
    prevent the expiration of a token, and the automatic revocation of
    it. Token renewal is possible only if there is a lease associated
    with it.  This is equivalent to calling \code{$renew()} with the
    client token.
  params:
    increment: *increment

revoke:
  short: >-
    Revokes a token and all child tokens. When the token is revoked,
    all dynamic secrets generated with it are also revoked.
  params:
    token: The token to revoke

revoke_self:
  short: >-
    Revokes the token used to call it and all child tokens. When the
    token is revoked, all dynamic secrets generated with it are also
    revoked.  This is equivalent to calling \code{$revoke()} with the
    client token.

revoke_accessor:
  short: >-
    Revoke the token associated with the accessor and all the child
    tokens. This is meant for purposes where there is no access to
    token ID but there is need to revoke a token and its children.
  params:
    accessor: Accessor of the token to revoke.

revoke_and_orphan:
  short: >-
    Revokes a token but not its child tokens. When the token is
    revoked, all secrets generated with it are also revoked. All child
    tokens are orphaned, but can be revoked sub-sequently using
    /auth/token/revoke/. This is a root-protected method.
  params:
    token: The token to revoke

role_read:
  short: Fetches the named role configuration.
  params:
    role_name: The name of the token role.

role_list:
  short: List available token roles.

role_write:
  # TODO: leases are not yet added to vaultr but once they are this
  # documentation should be updated.
  short: >-
    Creates (or replaces) the named role. Roles enforce specific
    behavior when creating tokens that allow token functionality that
    is otherwise not available or would require sudo/root privileges
    to access. Role parameters, when set, override any provided
    options to the create endpoints. The role name is also included in
    the token path, allowing all tokens created against a role to be
    revoked using the \code{/sys/leases/revoke-prefix} endpoint.
  params:
    role_name: >-
      Name for the role - this will be used later to refer to the role
      (e.g., in \code{$create} and other \code{$role_*} methods.
    allowed_policies: >-
      Character vector of policies allowed for this role.  If set,
      tokens can be created with any subset of the policies in this
      list, rather than the normal semantics of tokens being a subset
      of the calling token's policies. The parameter is a
      comma-delimited string of policy names. If at creation time
      \code{no_default_policy} is not set and "default" is not
      contained in disallowed_policies, the "default" policy will be
      added to the created token automatically.
    disallowed_policies: >-
      Character vector of policies forbidden for this role.  If set,
      successful token creation via this role will require that no
      policies in the given list are requested. Adding "default" to
      this list will prevent "default" from being added automatically
      to created tokens.
    orphan: >-
      If \code{TRUE}, then tokens created against this policy will be
      orphan tokens (they will have no parent). As such, they will not
      be automatically revoked by the revocation of any other token.
    period: >-
      A duration (e.g., \code{1h}).  If specified, the token will be
      periodic; it will have no maximum TTL (unless an
      "explicit-max-ttl" is also set) but every renewal will use the
      given period. Requires a root/sudo token to use.
    renewable: >-
      Set to \code{FALSE} to disable the ability of the token to be
      renewed past its initial TTL. The default value of \code{TRUE}
      will allow the token to be renewable up to the system/mount
      maximum TTL.
    explicit_max_ttl: >-
      An integer number of seconds.  Provides a maximum lifetime for
      any tokens issued against this role, including periodic
      tokens. Unlike direct token creation, where the value for an
      explicit max TTL is stored in the token, for roles this check
      will always use the current value set in the role. The main use
      of this is to provide a hard upper bound on periodic tokens,
      which otherwise can live forever as long as they are
      renewed. This is an integer number of seconds.
    # TODO: update docs once lease support is added
    path_suffix: >-
      A string.  If set, tokens created against this role will have
      the given suffix as part of their path in addition to the role
      name. This can be useful in certain scenarios, such as keeping
      the same role name in the future but revoking all tokens created
      against it before some point in time. The suffix can be changed,
      allowing new callers to have the new suffix as part of their
      path, and then tokens with the old suffix can be revoked via
      \code{/sys/leases/revoke-prefix}.
    bound_cidrs: >-
      Character vector of CIDRS.  If set, restricts usage of the
      generated token to client IPs falling within the range of the
      specified CIDR(s). Unlike most other role parameters, this is
      not reevaluated from the current role value at each usage; it is
      set on the token itself. Root tokens with no TTL will not be
      bound by these CIDRs; root tokens with TTLs will be bound by
      these CIDRs.
    token_type: >-
      Specifies the type of tokens that should be returned by the
      role. If either service or batch is specified, that kind of
      token will always be returned. If \code{default-service}, then
      \code{service} tokens will be returned unless the client
      requests a batch type token at token creation time. If
      \code{default-batch}, then \code{batch} tokens will be returned
      unless the client requests a service type token at token
      creation time.

role_delete:
  short: Delete a named token role
  params:
    role_name: The name of the role to delete

tidy:
  short: >-
    Performs some maintenance tasks to clean up invalid entries that
    may remain in the token store. Generally, running this is not
    needed unless upgrade notes or support personnel suggest it. This
    may perform a lot of I/O to the storage method so should be used
    sparingly.

login:
  short: >-
    Unlike other auth backend \code{login} methods, this does not
    actually log in to the vault.  Instead it verifies that a token
    can be used to communicate with the vault.
  params:
    token: The token to test
    quiet: >-
      Logical scalar, set to \code{TRUE} to suppress informational
      messages.
