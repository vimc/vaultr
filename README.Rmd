<!-- badges: end -->

Interact with [HashiCorp's vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), to securely use secrets from R.  This package wraps the [vault http API](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/index.html) to allow secrets to be accessed from R.  Secrets might be passwords, tokens, certificates or any other sensitive data.

* Authenticate with several different providers (token, username and password, GitHub, LDAP, and "approle")
* Read and write secrets into vault using its key-value stores (version 1 or 2), cubbyhole and in-transit "encryption-as-a-service"
* Inspect and work with vault tokens
* Read, write and update vault policies
* Allows a degree of access to operator maintenance
* Work with vault's audit devices

## Usage

```{r, include = FALSE}
srv <- vaultr::vault_test_server()
srv$export()
local({
  cl <- srv$client()
  cl$write("/secret/database/admin", list(value = "s3cret"))
  cl$write("/secret/database/readonly", list(value = "passw0rd"))
})
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = FALSE)
```

Create a vault client with the `vault_client` function:

```{r}
vault <- vaultr::vault_client(login = TRUE)
```

Interact with vault using this object:

```{r}
vault$list("secret/database")
```

and read secrets with

```{r}
vault$read("secret/database/admin")
```

```{r}
vault$read("secret/database/readonly", field = "value")
```

or set secrets with

```r
vault$write("secret/webserver", list(password = "horsestaple"))
vault$read("secret/webserver")
```

or delete secrets with

```r
vault$delete("/secret/database/readonly")
```

## Installation

Install `vaultr` from CRAN with

```r
install.packages("vaultr")
```

To install our internally released version (which might be ahead of CRAN) via drat, use


```r
install.packages(
  "vaultr",
  repos = c("https://vimc.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

or install the bleeding edge with

```r
remotes::install_gitub("vimc/vaultr", upgrade = FALSE)
```
